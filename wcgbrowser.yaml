# The "whitelist" is a list of domains or hosts which will be matched against any requested url.
# If the hostname or domain name doesn't match an item on the list, the user gets the "Cannot go there" message
# see the readme file for more details on the whitelist's behavior
# The start_url host and bookmark hosts are automatically added to the whitelist.
# To disable whitelist filtering, just comment out whitelist, leave it empty, or specify use "False" as the value.
# To just whitelist the start_url host and bookmark url host(s), just put "True".
# Otherwise, specify a list of domains or hostnames to be added to the whitelist.
# Default: empty (disabled)

# If your browser has to navigate to a password-protected site (e.g., htaccess), you can set a default

# Default: 0

timeout: 1800

# Default: "strict"

ssl_mode: "ignore"

# Set "fullscreen" to true to force the browser window fullscreen
# Default: False

fullscreen: False

# "window_size" sets the default size of the application window
# It can be a <width>x<height> value, like "800x600"

# it is ignored if "fullscreen" is set (either in the config or commandline)

# default is "I'm Finished"

#quit_button_text: "Quit"

# "page_unavailable_html" is the path to a *file* that contains html to be displayed whenever a page cannot be accessed,
# either because it's not available, or blocked due to security rules (whitelist, e.g.).
# The file should be on the local system, and only reference local resources (css, scripts, etc).

# Leave it commented to use the default text built into the browser.
# Default: empty

#page_unavailable_html: "examples/custom404.html"

# "network_down_html" is the path to a *file* that contains html to be displayed whenever the start_url's host cannot be reached,
# which is very likely indicative of a network connectivity problem (rather than, say, a security restriction)
# The file should be on the local system, and only reference local resources (css, scripts, etc).
# It doesn't have to be a full page, or even HTML if you just want a simple text message.
# Leave it commented to use the default text built into the browser.
# Default: empty

#network_down_html: "examples/custom_network_down.html"

# Printing can be enabled by setting "allow_printing" to "True"
# When enabled, "print" will appear in the page's context menu.
# If "print" is included in the navigation layout, it will put a print button
# on the navigation bar too.
# Default: False

#allow_printing: True

# Several printing defaults can be set to allow silent printing. Please see the README.rst file for an explanation of all the options.
# Default: empty

#print_settings:
#    silent: True

#    paper_size: [500, 1000]
#    margins: [5, 5, 8, 8]

# Default: WebKit default user agent

#user_agent: "Firefox IE WebKit Chrome Mosaic Navigator"

# user_css allows a custom CSS file to be applied to each page WCGBrowser visits. Accepts any URL supported by QT
# Default: none

#user_css: file://etc/wcgbrowser.css

# Bookmarks are set in this structure.  They will appear as buttons on the top navigation bar.
# Each bookmark entry takes this form (note the indentation):
#
# key:
#   name: "&Button Label"
#   url: "http://www.example.com"
#   description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# Where "key" can be whatever you want -- most simply, a number.  The bookmarks will be sorted by key before
# being displayed, so this allows you to control the order in which they appear.
#
# There is also an older, simpler syntax that just uses the key as the name.  The downside
# is that you have no control over the order of the buttons.
#
# "&Button Label":
#    url: "http://www.example.com"
#    description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# The ampersand is optional, but if present the character following it will be the keyboard accelerator
# (e.g., in the example alt-B would activate the bookmark)
# Default: empty

bookmarks:
  1:
    name: "Catalog &Home"

# External Content
# If allow_external_content is set to True, clicking a link to an un-renderable MIME-type (PDF, for example)

# Default: False

#allow_external_content: True

# If you're allowing external content, then you need to specify what to do with a given MIME type.
# Otherwise, the user will get an error indicating the browser doesn't know what to do with it.
# Content handlers for external files can be specified here
# The format is
# "content-type": "program to open with"
# The filename of the downloaded data will be passed as an argument
